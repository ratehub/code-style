## Rule Discussion:
| Rule | Class | Discussion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[for-direction]](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/for-direction) | OFF | While it is suggested that any non-forward iteration require a comment pointing out the deviation to the developer, there are many cases where backward iteration is desired and a clearer way of implementation a solution |
| [[getter-return]](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/getter-return) | ERROR | Every `get` can reasonabily be expected to return a value.  No return is likely an unintended omission |

# PHP code style

We'll use PSR 1 & 2 to stay in line with the PHP community.

- https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/
- https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/

## .editorconfig
Use the example in this directory

## PHP_CODESNIFFER
Repos with PHP code should bring in PHP code sniffer for automatic style checking.
You can use the example phpcs.xml here to configure it

## PHPStorm formatting
- Navigate to Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> PHP and choose "set from" at the top right. Choose PSR2.

## Sublime
- TODO: Someone using sublime please help write a guide.

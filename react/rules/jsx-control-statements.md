## Chosen Rule Set
For this plugin, we have chosen the [recommended rule set](https://github.com/vkbansal/eslint-plugin-jsx-control-statements/blob/master/index.js#L29).  If deviations from the rule set are made, they will be listed and discussed here.

## Deviations
* [[jsx-for-require-body]](https://github.com/vkbansal/eslint-plugin-jsx-control-statements/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-for-require-body.md): We do not want to enforce this rule as we generally prefer to use <For> with children.

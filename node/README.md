# Ratehub Node Style Guide
*Node coding style focusing on readability and maintainability*

## Statement of Purpose
The severity/classification of each rule is driver by 3 primary drivers:
* catching mistakes
* preventing bad design (easier to change/maintain)
* minimizing code complexity (easier to read)

## Suggesting Changes
If disagreement with a rule's classification or changes to the plugins chosen are desired, please open a [ticket](https://github.com/ratehub/code-style/issues).  Pull requests against this repository require changes to the associated markup document so the rationale and rule configuration will stay in-sync.

# RateHub React Style guide
*Company-wide coding style checker for making React projects accessible*

## Packages Used:
* [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)@6.0.3: industry-standard accessibility checker when using React.

### Configuration Used:
we are using the ['strict'](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y#difference-between-recommended-and-strict-mode) rule set because accessibility should be a first-class citizen in our designs.  If deviations from the rule set are made, they will be listed and discussed here.
